# 2D-Shooting-Game

This is a simple two-player 2D shooting game with obstacles. 

## Overview

At the starting screen, the player has the option to choose music to play in the background. They can press '1', '2', or '3' to select their choice of background music. When the game loads, there are two squirrel avatars that automatically move up and down the screen. There are also randomly generated cactus obstacles (five to eight) between the two squirrels. Each player can press a key to shoot–either 's' or 'k'–with the goal of hitting the other player. If they hit an obstacle, their bullet breaks. A player cannot shoot again until the other player has made a shot. At the bottom of the screen, there is a scoreboard to keep track of a player’s wins. Once a player gets five wins, they win the game. Once a player wins the game, there is a display and instructions for them to press ‘f’ if they would like to play again.
